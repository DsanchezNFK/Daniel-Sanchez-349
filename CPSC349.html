  <h1>Why CPSC 349?</h1>
  <p>CPSC 349 to me is an opportunity to get experience with a highly sought after skillset without being completely on my own.
    Many internships and job oppportunities prefer or require candidates to have web development knowledge. I hope to learn the foundational skills
    that I need to jumpstart my learning, so that eventually I will be an attractive candidate.
